# Challenge One

## Description

This project is the first challenge of the bootcamp. My motivation behind this project was to learn semantic elements.
I learned how to change non-semantic elements to semantic and modify the CSS accordingly.

## Usage

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

After all elements were changed to proper semantic with CSS adjusted, the app's functionality remained identical.
